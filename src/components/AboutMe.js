        Hello my name is Daniel Peterson, I have been writing code for two years before starting college in 2018. Since then I have managed to
        learn a lot of different languages. Some from class some on my own, I have enjoyed all the work I have put in so far and am looking to expand
        to a new goal soon and I feel a job in web development will be the perfect adventure for me at this time.

        After my High School graduation from Dishman Hills Highschool I had already been applied to and prepared for the transition to Spokane Community College,
        I have been attending Spokane Community College since, I plan to be done with my Associative Arts degree by the end of the winter quarter of 2021.
        Next fall I plan on transferring to Eastern Washington University where I will secure my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.
